# Ecosystem Working Group

> Coordination repository of the ecosystem Working Group (WG)

This repository [issue tracker] is used by the ecosystem WG to coordinate efforts that support the wider Rust ecosystem.

Also reach out on [gitter] to find out where you can get involved.

## Vision

> _Supporting **sustainable consumption** of a **mature ecosystem**_

The ecosystem working group is like the [2017 libz blitz] but a bit less structured. It will look at more perspectives on building, stabilizing, maintaining, and consuming Rust libraries.

### Sustainable Consumption

- Support stabilizing libraries growing their maintainership
- Collect our experiences from maintaining Rust libraries into a set of Maintainership Guidelines

### Mature Ecosystem

- Polish the API Guidelines to `1.0`
- Polish the Cookbook to `1.0`
- Support better visibility and discoverability of the crates ecosystem
- Support more libz-blitz-style evaluations
- Look at cross-cutting ecosystem concerns
